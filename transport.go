// Transport is an implementation of [RoundTripper] that supports HTTP,
// HTTPS, and HTTP proxies (for either HTTP or HTTPS with CONNECT).
//
// By default, Transport caches connections for future re-use.
// This may leave many open connections when accessing many hosts.
// This behavior can be managed using [Transport.CloseIdleConnections] method
// and the [Transport.MaxIdleConnsPerHost] and [Transport.DisableKeepAlives] fields.
//
// Transports should be reused instead of created as needed.
// Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// A Transport is a low-level primitive for making HTTP and HTTPS requests.
// For high-level functionality, such as cookies and redirects, see [Client].
//
// Transport uses HTTP/1.1 for HTTP URLs and either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2
// for HTTPS URLs, depending on whether the server supports HTTP/2,
// and how the Transport is configured. The [DefaultTransport] supports HTTP/2.
// To explicitly enable HTTP/2 on a transport, set [Transport.Protocols].
//
// Responses with status codes in the 1xx range are either handled
// automatically (100 expect-continue) or ignored. The one
// exception is HTTP status code 101 (Switching Protocols), which is
// considered a terminal status and returned by [Transport.RoundTrip]. To see the
// ignored 1xx responses, use the httptrace trace package's
// ClientTrace.Got1xxResponse.
//
// Transport only retries a request upon encountering a network error
// if the connection has been already been used successfully and if the
// request is idempotent and either has no body or has its [Request.GetBody]
// defined. HTTP requests are considered idempotent if they have HTTP methods
// GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, or TRACE; or if their [Header] map contains an
// "Idempotency-Key" or "X-Idempotency-Key" entry. If the idempotency key
// value is a zero-length slice, the request is treated as idempotent but the
// header is not sent on the wire.

// ProxyFromEnvironment returns the URL of the proxy to use for a

// matching their scheme, unless excluded by NO_PROXY.
//
// The environment values may be either a complete URL or a
// "host[:port]", in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
// An error is returned if the value is a different form.
//
// A nil URL and nil error are returned if no proxy is defined in the
// environment, or a proxy should not be used for the given request,
// as defined by NO_PROXY.
//
// As a special case, if req.URL.Host is "localhost" (with or without
// a port number), then a nil URL and nil error will be returned.
